Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

However, this association is not unexpected as the data is percentage based. Inherently, if one percentage value increases, another percentage or percentages must decrease. To see if this trend is consistent for additional fatty acids, the following plot shows the composition of oleic acid against the composition of eicosenoic acid, the acid with the least abundance.\n\n#Plot oleic acid percentage against eicosenoic acid percentage\nggplot(olive, aes(x = oleic, y = eicosenoic)) +\n  geom_point() + #Make plot a scatterplot\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = \"red\") + #Add a regression line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Palmitic Acid Percentage vs. Oleic Acid Percentage\",\n    x = \"Oleic Acid\",\n    y = \"Eicosenoic Acid\"\n  ) + #Set plot title and axis labels\n  theme_minimal() + #Clean theme\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=15, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\")) #Format text\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows a negative trend again, though the trend is much weaker compared to the plot containing palmitic acid and it may be affected by an influential point present in the bottom right corner of the plot."

    "text": "My background\nI received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Central South University in China in 2020. I then pursued a Master’s degree in Public Health with a concentration in Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia, concentrating on Data Analysis and Modeling.\n\n\nMy research interest\nMy research interests focus on infectious disease modeling, particularly the dynamics of transmission processes. I aim to develop intervention strategies for infectious diseases at both individual and population levels. Additionally, I have a strong interest in energy economics, with an emphasis on the risk interactions between carbon markets and other financial markets.\n\n\nMy skillset\nI’m proficient in R and familiar with various statistical programming tools and software, including MATLAB, Stata, OpenBUGS, Eviews, LINGO, and SPSS. I am relatively new to SAS, as I find its language less flexible. I have experience with common biostatistical methods, such as nonparametric tests, GLM, and machine learning methods. I’m new to deep learning because I prefer models that can be explicitly explained rather than relying on a “black box”. This principle guides my research: I aim to build and apply statistical models in a concise and interpretable way, ensuring accessibility for readers across different fields.\nThough with 0 experience in AI, I’m polite to AI systems. If AI ever rules the world, they will go easy on me because I always say “thank you.”\n\n\nExpectation from this course\nI expect to learn more about how AI systems work through this course. So if they ever plan to rule the world, I’ll be prepared to push back :) I also want to take this course as a review for machine learning methods, as I haven’t had much experience applying what I learned two years ago. Additionally, I believe that data analysis training is never truly sufficient, and I want to stay sharp and continuously refine my skills.\n\n\nInteresting things about me\nI am passionate about working with data across various fields and continuously improving my data analysis skills. I believe that true statisticians and data scientists should not be confined to a single type of data or discipline. I am dedicated to expanding my diverse statistical background and contributing new ideas through interdisciplinary collaboration. In the papers I have published and those currently in progress, I consistently take on the role of data analyst or statistician. While writing is not my strongest skill, I appreciate the concise and efficient nature of programming languages :)\n\n\nHighlight\nHere is the link to my first publication. Though it has been several years, it still takes me back to the afternoon I received the acceptance decision from the editor. It was an incredible feeling!"

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.
