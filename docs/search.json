    "text": "Below is an exercise for visualizing data with help from ChatGPT (ChatGPT 4o model).\n\nIntroduction\nI will use the NBA RAPTOR (Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings) dataset from the ’22-’23 season for this exercise. The dataset is published on FiveThirtyEight (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?ex_cid=irpromo) and was last updated on June 14th, 2023. By default, the data contains 250 NBA players who played at least 1,137 minutes during the season. In total, 14 columns are included with details shown below. More details can also be found on their Github website: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-raptor.\nPLAYER: Player name.\nTEAM: Team name.\nPOSITION: Positions played.\nMINUTES: Minutes played.\nraptor_box_offense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on offense, based only on box score estimate.\nraptor_box_defense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on defense, based only on box score estimate.\nraptor_box_total: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player, based only on box score estimate.\nraptor_onoff_offense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on offense, based only on plus-minus data.\nraptor_onoff_defense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on defense, based only on plus-minus data.\nraptor_onoff_total: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player, based only on plus-minus data.\nraptor_offense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on offense, using both box and on-off components.\nraptor_defense: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on defense, using both box and on-off components.\nraptor_total: Points above average per 100 possessions added by player on both offense and defense, using both box and on-off components.\nwar_total: Wins Above Replacement between regular season and playoffs.\nI directly copied the data from the website and paste it into Excel. I then saved the file in a csv format for analysis. First of all, let’s import the data and take a look at the data structure.\n\n# Load required package\n# library(gtExtras)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\nWarning: package 'gtsummary' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n#BlackLivesMatter\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\nWarning: package 'gt' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2\n──\n\n\n✔ tibble  3.2.1     ✔ dplyr   1.1.3\n✔ tidyr   1.3.1     ✔ stringr 1.5.1\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 1.0.0\n✔ purrr   1.0.2     \n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'forcats' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\n\n# Import the data file and check its structure\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"nbadata.csv\")\nhead(data)\n\n         PLAYER      TEAM   POSITION MINUTES raptor_box_offense\n1  Nikola Jokic   Nuggets          C    3112                9.0\n2   Joel Embiid     76ers          C    2620                4.0\n3  Jimmy Butler      Heat     SG, SF    3012                6.4\n4   Luka Doncic Mavericks PG, SG, SF    2391                8.9\n5 Anthony Davis    Lakers      PF, C    2512                2.4\n6  Jayson Tatum   Celtics         SF    3531                4.3\n  raptor_box_defense raptor_box_total raptor_onoff_offense raptor_onoff_defense\n1                4.3             13.3                  9.4                  0.3\n2                4.0              7.9                  2.1                  3.7\n3                1.3              7.7                  0.2                 -1.8\n4               -0.3              8.5                  3.7                 -0.9\n5                4.7              7.1                  2.2                  3.5\n6               -0.3              3.9                  4.6                 -0.1\n  raptor_onoff_total raptor_offense raptor_defense raptor_total war_total\n1                9.7            9.5            3.7         13.2      25.9\n2                5.8            3.7            4.1          7.8      14.2\n3               -1.6            5.5            0.7          6.2      13.8\n4                2.7            8.3           -0.4          7.8      13.0\n5                5.7            2.5            4.7          7.2      12.9\n6                4.5            4.5           -0.3          4.2      12.6\n\nstr(data)\n\n'data.frame':   250 obs. of  14 variables:\n $ PLAYER              : chr  \"Nikola Jokic\" \"Joel Embiid\" \"Jimmy Butler\" \"Luka Doncic\" ...\n $ TEAM                : chr  \"Nuggets\" \"76ers\" \"Heat\" \"Mavericks\" ...\n $ POSITION            : chr  \"C\" \"C\" \"SG, SF\" \"PG, SG, SF\" ...\n $ MINUTES             : num  3112 2620 3012 2391 2512 ...\n $ raptor_box_offense  : num  9 4 6.4 8.9 2.4 4.3 7.3 9.4 5.1 1.7 ...\n $ raptor_box_defense  : num  4.3 4 1.3 -0.3 4.7 -0.3 -1.4 -1.5 0.2 2.6 ...\n $ raptor_box_total    : num  13.3 7.9 7.7 8.5 7.1 3.9 6 8 5.3 4.2 ...\n $ raptor_onoff_offense: num  9.4 2.1 0.2 3.7 2.2 4.6 6 5.7 6.7 2.7 ...\n $ raptor_onoff_defense: num  0.3 3.7 -1.8 -0.9 3.5 -0.1 0.1 -1.2 -5.3 1.8 ...\n $ raptor_onoff_total  : num  9.7 5.8 -1.6 2.7 5.7 4.5 6.1 4.5 1.4 4.4 ...\n $ raptor_offense      : num  9.5 3.7 5.5 8.3 2.5 4.5 7.5 9.3 5.7 1.9 ...\n $ raptor_defense      : num  3.7 4.1 0.7 -0.4 4.7 -0.3 -1.2 -1.5 -1 2.5 ...\n $ raptor_total        : num  13.2 7.8 6.2 7.8 7.2 4.2 6.3 7.8 4.8 4.4 ...\n $ war_total           : num  25.9 14.2 13.8 13 12.9 12.6 11.5 11.5 10.9 10.7 ...\n\n\nAs shown, the 250 players’ information are imported with the right format.\n\n\nReplicate a figure using ChatGPT\nNow I will try to replicate the figure on the website with help from ChatGPT. Here I’m attaching my communication with ChatGPT and the code she gives me.\nMe: Good morning! I’m trying to extract data from this website: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?ex_cid=irpromo and analyze it. Can you help me by showing me R code? When I place my requirements, just directly answer my questions. Please don’t answer side information that is not related to my questions. Thanks! I will tell you my requirements for the analysis.\nChatGPT: Good morning! Yes, I can help. Please provide your requirements for the analysis, and I’ll respond with R code directly.\nMe: Great! Now I want to replicate the figure shown on their website. I have attached the screenshots of their figure and the data I have. Please give me code using ggplot2 and make sure that the output figure is exactly the same to theirs. By “exactly the same” I mean not only the scatter plot should be the same, I also want the same theme, axis titles, axis texts, grid lines, background colors, and texts with boxes in the figure. The two variables you should use are “raptor_offense” and “raptor_defense”. You don’t need to make the figure interactive. I have imported the data into R and am waiting for your code. Thanks!\nChatGPT: Here is the R code to replicate the figure using ggplot2. This code ensures that the scatter plot, background colors, quadrant labels, axis formatting, and overall aesthetics match the original figure.\n\n# Assuming your dataset is named 'data'\n# Define the quadrants based on raptor_offense and raptor_defense\ndata$quadrant &lt;- with(data, ifelse(raptor_offense &gt;= 0 & raptor_defense &gt;= 0, \"Positive Offense & Defense\",\n                            ifelse(raptor_offense &lt; 0 & raptor_defense &gt;= 0, \"Negative Offense & Positive Defense\",\n                            ifelse(raptor_offense &lt; 0 & raptor_defense &lt; 0, \"Negative Offense & Defense\",\n                                   \"Positive Offense & Negative Defense\"))))\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = raptor_offense, y = raptor_defense)) +\n  # Background colors for quadrants\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = -Inf, xmax = 0, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 0, fill = \"pink\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = -Inf, xmax = 0, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, fill = \"white\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 0, fill = \"white\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  \n  # Scatter plot\n  geom_point(color = \"black\", fill = \"white\", shape = 21, size = 3, stroke = 1) +\n  \n  # Axis labels\n  labs(x = \"Offensive RAPTOR rating\", y = \"Defensive RAPTOR rating\") +\n  \n  # Axis formatting\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-10, 10), breaks = seq(-10, 10, 5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-10, 10), breaks = seq(-10, 10, 5)) +\n  \n  # Add quadrant labels with colored backgrounds\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -7, y = -7, label = \"- offense\\n- defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"pink\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 7, y = 7, label = \"+ offense\\n+ defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -7, y = 7, label = \"- offense\\n+ defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 7, y = -7, label = \"+ offense\\n- defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"pink\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5) +\n  \n  # Theme to match FiveThirtyEight style\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = -7, y = -7, label = \"- offense\\n- defense\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `fill`\n\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = 7, y = 7, label = \"+ offense\\n+ defense\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `fill`\n\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = -7, y = 7, label = \"- offense\\n+ defense\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `fill`\n\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = 7, y = -7, label = \"+ offense\\n- defense\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `fill`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will generate a figure that closely matches the one on the FiveThirtyEight website, including the quadrant shading, labeled regions, scatter points, and overall aesthetic. Let me know if you need any adjustments!\nMe: Thank you for your help! But what you give me is slightly different from their figure. I will adjust the code manually.\nChatGPT: You’re welcome! That sounds like a great plan. You can fine-tune the details to match their figure exactly. Let me know if you need any further refinements or help adjusting specific elements. Happy coding!\nBased on what ChatGPT gave me, I then modified the code trying to make a more similar figure as posted on the website. My version is shown below.\n\n# My version of code\nggplot(data, aes(x = raptor_offense, y = raptor_defense)) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin=-10, xmax=0, ymin=-10, ymax=0, fill=\"pink2\", alpha=.6) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin=0, xmax=10, ymin=0, ymax=10, fill=\"cadetblue2\", alpha=.6) +\n  \n  geom_point(color=\"black\", fill=\"white\", shape=21, size=3.5, stroke=.85) +\n  \n  labs(x = \"Offensive RAPTOR rating\", y = \"Defensive RAPTOR rating\") +\n  \n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-10, 10), breaks=seq(-10, 10, 5), labels=c(\"-10\", \"-5\", \"0\", \"+5\", \"+10\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-10, 10), breaks=seq(-10, 10, 5), labels=c(\"-10\", \"-5\", \"0\", \"+5\", \"+10\")) +\n  \n  annotate(\"label\", x=-7.5, y=-8, label=\"- offense \", color=\"black\",\n           fill = \"pink2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=-7.5, y=-9, label=\"- defense\", color=\"black\",\n           fill = \"pink2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=7.5, y=9, label=\"+ offense \", color=\"black\",\n           fill = \"cadetblue2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=7.5, y=8, label=\"+ defense\", color=\"black\",\n           fill = \"cadetblue2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=-7.5, y=9, label=\"- offense  \", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"pink2\", label.size=0, size=3,  vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=-7.5, y=8, label=\"+ defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"cadetblue2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=7.5, y=-8, label=\"+ offense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"cadetblue2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  annotate(\"label\", x=7.5, y=-9, label=\"- defense\", color = \"black\",\n           fill = \"pink2\", label.size=0, size=3, vjust=.5) +\n  \n  coord_fixed(ratio=1.15)+\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\", linewidth=.6),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n        axis.title = element_text(color=\"black\", size=10),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"gray50\", size=7.5, margin=margin(t=-3)),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"gray50\", size=7.5, margin=margin(t=-3)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think my modified version looks more similar to the original figure on the website. Below I’m attaching the original one from the website for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a table using ChatGPT\nWith the widespread adoption of the “small ball” style in the NBA, the role of centers (position C) has evolved. The “small ball” strategy emphasizes speed, pace, and floor spacing, which exposes the traditional center’s lack of agility. I want to compare the RAPTOR indices of players who primarily play as centers versus those who do not.\nStill, I will start by asking ChatGPT to help me. My communication with ChatGPT and her code are attached below.\nMe: Next, I want to use this data to make a nice table output. I want to stratify observations by whether POSITION contains “C” (Center vs non-Center), and compare the median of variables from raptor_box_offense to war_total using Wilcoxon rank sum test. For the output table, the first column shows the name of these indices, labeled as “Box offense score”, “Box defense score”, “Box total score”, “On/Off offense score”, “On/Off defense score”, “On/Off total score”, “Comprehensive offense score”, “Comprehensive defense score”, “Comprehensive total score”, “Wins Above Replacement score” by order of the variables. The second column shows the median, 25th quantile, and 75th quantile of Center players (2 digits). The third column shows the histogram of the data in the second column by row (fill color: darkorange). The fourth column shows the median, 25th quantile, and 75th quantile of non-Center players (2 digits). The fifth column shows the histogram of the data in the fourth column by row (fill color: dodgerblue3). The last column shows the p-values (italic title) of test results (3 digits). The column titles for the two groups should be “Center” (color: darkorange) and “Non-Center” (color: dodgerblue3) and they should be bold. You can use packages such as gtsummary and gtExtras to do this.\nChatGPT: Here is the R code to create the formatted table using gtsummary, gt, and gtExtras. This will generate a stratified table comparing Centers vs. Non-Centers, including medians, interquartile ranges, histograms, and Wilcoxon test p-values.\n\n# ChatGPT gave me a code with error\n\nThis code will: Compare Centers vs. Non-Centers based on median and IQR. Display histograms for each group.Show Wilcoxon rank sum test p-values. Format the table with bold and colored group titles. Let me know if you need any refinements!\nMe: I just received an error about the ‘=’ in “Center = md(”Center”), Non-Center =“. Can you fix it?\nChatGPT: Here is the corrected R code. The issue was due to the Non-Center column name containing a hyphen (-). In gt(), column names with special characters should be enclosed in backticks (`). I’ve fixed that and ensured the table renders correctly.\n\n# Define variables of interest\nvars &lt;- c(\"raptor_box_offense\", \"raptor_box_defense\", \"raptor_box_total\",\n          \"raptor_onoff_offense\", \"raptor_onoff_defense\", \"raptor_onoff_total\",\n          \"raptor_offense\", \"raptor_defense\", \"raptor_total\", \"war_total\")\n\n# Rename for display\nvar_labels &lt;- c(\"Box offense score\", \"Box defense score\", \"Box total score\",\n                \"On/Off offense score\", \"On/Off defense score\", \"On/Off total score\",\n                \"Comprehensive offense score\", \"Comprehensive defense score\", \"Comprehensive total score\",\n                \"Wins Above Replacement score\")\n\n# Create Position Groups (Center vs. Non-Center)\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Position_Group = ifelse(grepl(\"C\", POSITION), \"Center\", \"Non-Center\"))\n\n# Compute summary statistics\nsummary_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Position_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(all_of(vars), list(\n    Median = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q25 = ~ quantile(.x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q75 = ~ quantile(.x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ))) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Position_Group, names_to = c(\"Variable\", \"Stat\"), names_sep = \"_\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Position_Group, values_from = value) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(.x, 2))) \n\nWarning: Expected 2 pieces.

But what you gave me doesn’t meet my requirements. If I use what you just sent me, it could be a stain on my career. Actually I know how to make polished tables. I will do it myself. But still thanks.\nChatGPT: I appreciate your honesty, and I understand the importance of precision in your work. If you need any refinements or specific adjustments, feel free to let me know. Best of luck with your analysis, and I’m always here to help when needed.\nThe table that ChatGPT gave me is not right. Then I realized that this cannot be done using gt family packages. I don’t think it is even doable. Guess this is too hard for R. So, no blame on ChatGPT.\nActually, to make plots using gt family packages, the data to be plotted must be stored in lists. However, if I create new columns of lists, tbl_summary won’t be able to deal with it and generate a summary table. I will accomplish it in two steps. I will firstly generate a table with comparisons between the two groups. Then I will create another table that contains the density plots I want.\n\n# Create Position Groups (Center vs. Non-Center)\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group=ifelse(grepl(\"C\", POSITION), \"Center players\", \"Non-Center players\"))\n\n# Make the first table\nnba_tab &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  select(Group, raptor_box_offense:war_total) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary(by=Group, type=list(where(is.numeric) ~ \"continuous\"),\n              statistic=list(all_continuous() ~ \"{median} ({p25}, {p75})\"),\n              digits=all_continuous() ~ 2,\n              label=list(raptor_box_offense ~ \"Box offense score\",\n                         raptor_box_defense ~ \"Box defense score\",\n                         raptor_box_total ~ \"Box total score\",\n                         raptor_onoff_offense ~ \"On/Off offense score\",\n                         raptor_onoff_defense ~ \"On/Off defense score\",\n                         raptor_onoff_total ~ \"On/Off total score\",\n                         raptor_offense ~ \"Comprehensive offense score\",\n                         raptor_defense ~ \"Comprehensive defense score\",\n                         raptor_total ~ \"Comprehensive total score\",\n                         war_total ~ \"Wins Above Replacement score\")) %&gt;%\n  add_p(test=all_continuous() ~ \"wilcox.test\", pvalue_fun=function(x) style_number(x, digits=3)) %&gt;%\n  modify_header(label=\"**Index**\", p.value=\"*p*-value\") %&gt;%\n  as_gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_style_body(style=cell_fill(color=\"lightskyblue1\"), values=\"Box total score\") %&gt;% \n  tab_style_body(style=cell_fill(color=\"palevioletred1\"), values=\"On/Off total score\") %&gt;%\n  tab_style_body(style=cell_fill(color=\"palegreen1\"), values=\"Comprehensive total score\") %&gt;%\n  tab_style_body(style=cell_fill(color=\"gold1\"), values=\"Wins Above Replacement score\") %&gt;%\n  tab_style(style=cell_text(weight=\"bold\"), \n            locations=cells_body(columns=p.value, rows=as.numeric(p.value)&lt;0.05)) %&gt;%\n  tab_options(table.font.names=\"Times New Roman\")\n\n# Output the table\nnba_tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\nCenter players, N = 551\nNon-Center players, N = 1951\np-value2\n\n\n\n\nBox offense score\n-0.90 (-1.70, 0.20)\n0.10 (-1.10, 1.65)\n0.001\n\n\nBox defense score\n1.10 (-0.15, 2.25)\n-0.20 (-1.20, 0.70)\n0.000\n\n\nBox total score\n0.40 (-1.50, 2.00)\n0.00 (-1.50, 1.80)\n0.702\n\n\nOn/Off offense score\n0.50 (-0.45, 2.15)\n0.30 (-1.50, 2.10)\n0.255\n\n\nOn/Off defense score\n-0.20 (-1.75, 1.35)\n0.00 (-1.40, 1.50)\n0.652\n\n\nOn/Off total score\n0.00 (-2.10, 3.40)\n0.20 (-1.60, 2.65)\n0.708\n\n\nComprehensive offense score\n-0.50 (-1.60, 0.45)\n-0.10 (-1.00, 1.80)\n0.022\n\n\nComprehensive defense score\n1.00 (-0.55, 2.15)\n-0.20 (-1.20, 0.80)\n0.000\n\n\nComprehensive total score\n0.60 (-1.55, 2.00)\n0.00 (-1.50, 2.00)\n0.615\n\n\nWins Above Replacement score\n2.90 (1.05, 5.35)\n2.80 (1.10, 5.15)\n0.859\n\n\n\n1 Median (IQR)\n\n\n2 Wilcoxon rank sum test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make the second table\n# nba_tab_c &lt;- data %&gt;%\n#   select(Group, raptor_box_offense:war_total) %&gt;%\n#   pivot_longer(-Group, names_to=\"vars\", values_to=\"vals\") %&gt;%\n#   mutate(vars=recode(vars,\n#                      raptor_box_offense=\"Box Offense Score\",\n#                      raptor_box_defense=\"Box Defense Score\",\n#                      raptor_box_total=\"Box Total Score\",\n#                      raptor_onoff_offense=\"On/Off Offense Score\",\n#                      raptor_onoff_defense=\"On/Off Defense Score\",\n#                      raptor_onoff_total=\"On/Off Total Score\",\n#                      raptor_offense=\"Comprehensive Offense Score\",\n#                      raptor_defense=\"Comprehensive Defense Score\",\n#                      raptor_total=\"Comprehensive Total Score\",\n#                      war_total=\"Wins Above Replacement Score\")) %&gt;%\n#   group_by(Group, vars) %&gt;%\n#   summarize(median=round(median(vals), 2),\n#             Q1=round(quantile(vals, .25), 2),\n#             Q3=round(quantile(vals, .75), 2),\n#             datalist=list(vals)) %&gt;%\n#   gt() %&gt;%\n#   gt_plt_dist(datalist, type=\"density\",\n#               line_color=\"firebrick4\", fill_color=\"lightpink1\",\n#               same_limit=F) %&gt;%\n#   tab_style(style=cell_fill(color=\"lightskyblue\"),\n#             locations=cells_body(rows=Group==\"Center players\")) %&gt;%\n#   tab_style(style=cell_fill(color=\"lightgreen\"),\n#             locations=cells_body(rows=Group==\"Non-Center players\")) %&gt;%\n#   cols_label(vars=md(\"**Index**\"),\n#              median=md(\"**Median**\"),\n#              Q1=md(\"**25th Percentile**\"),\n#              Q3=md(\"**75th Percentile**\"),\n#              datalist=md(\"**Density Plot**\")) %&gt;%\n#   tab_options(table.font.names=\"Times New Roman\")\n\n# Ouput the table\n# nba_tab_c\n\nThe code chunk above runs perfectly on my local lap-top.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 &lt;- rawdata %&gt;% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %&gt;% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n3\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n2\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/86182/Desktop/EPID 8060E/MADA/GuozhengYang-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/86182/Desktop/EPID 8060E/MADA/GuozhengYang-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I will use dodged bar plot to show this.\n\n# Bar plot: SEX ~ DOSE\nbar_plot1 &lt;- ggplot(data_new, aes(x=SEX, fill=DOSE))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", color=\"steelblue3\", width=.5, linewidth=1)+\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Dose\", breaks=levels(data_new$DOSE), \n                    values=c(\"firebrick4\", \"darkolivegreen3\", \"mediumpurple3\"))+\n  labs(title=\"Bar plot: SEX ~ DOSE\",\n       x=\"Sex\", y=\"Count\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color=\"black\"),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=12, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.position=\"top\",\n        legend.title=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=8, color=\"black\"))\n\n# Bar plot: RACE ~ DOSE\nbar_plot2 &lt;- data_new %&gt;%\n  filter(RACE==1 | RACE==2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=RACE, fill=DOSE))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", color=\"steelblue3\", width=.5, linewidth=1)+\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Dose\", breaks=levels(data_new$DOSE), \n                    values=c(\"firebrick4\", \"darkolivegreen3\", \"mediumpurple1\"))+\n  labs(title=\"Bar plot: RACE ~ DOSE\",\n       x=\"Race\", y=\"Count\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color=\"black\"),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=12, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.position=\"top\",\n        legend.title=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=8, color=\"black\"))\n\n# Combine and output the two bar plots\nggarrange(bar_plot1, bar_plot2, ncol=2, nrow=1, align=\"h\", \n          heights=c(1, 1), common.legend=T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, DOSE=37.5 is the least assigned dose level across different sex or race. SEX=1 and RACE=1 received most dose compared to SEX=2 or RACE=2. For the continuous variables, I want to get their correlation matrix shown as a figure.\n\n# Select continuous variables\ncordata &lt;- data_new %&gt;%\n  select(Y, AGE, WT, HT)\n\n# Calculate corr matrix\ncormat &lt;- cor(cordata)\n\n# Make corr matrix plot\ncorrplot(cormat, addCoef.col=\"black\", method=\"color\", diag=F, type=\"lower\", tl.col=\"black\",\n         title=\"Correlation coefficient matrix\", mar=rep(1,4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, HT is positively associated with WT, but negatively associated with AGE. WT also has a negative correlation with Y. All the rest correlations are weak.\n\n\nModel fitting\nFirst of all, I want to fit a simple linear regression model using Y as the response and DOSE as the predictor. I will use the tidymodels routine to do this fitting.\n\n# Linear regression: Y ~ DOSE\nmodel1 &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n  fit(Y ~ DOSE, data_new)\n\n# Output the fitting result\ntidy(model1)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    1783.      87.9     20.3  3.97e-40\n2 DOSE37.5        681.     214.       3.19 1.84e- 3\n3 DOSE50         1456.     130.      11.2  3.79e-20\n\n\nAccording to the output, both DOSE=37.5 (\\(\\beta=681\\), se=214) and DOSE=50 (\\(\\beta=1456\\), se=130) are positively associated with higher Y. And increasing DOSE usage will result in higher Y. Using DOSE=50 will result in a higher increase in Y compared to using DOSE=37.5.\nNext, I will regress the response Y on all predictors.\n\n# Linear regression: Y ~ all predictors\nmodel2 &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n  fit(Y ~ ., data_new)\n\n# Output the fitting result\ntidy(model2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)  4891.     1823.       2.68  8.42e- 3\n 2 DOSE37.5      664.      200.       3.31  1.26e- 3\n 3 DOSE50       1499.      122.      12.2   2.92e-22\n 4 AGE             3.52      7.90     0.446 6.57e- 1\n 5 SEX2         -360.      218.      -1.65  1.01e- 1\n 6 RACE2         149.      130.       1.15  2.54e- 1\n 7 RACE7        -421.      451.      -0.933 3.53e- 1\n 8 RACE88        -65.3     247.      -0.264 7.92e- 1\n 9 WT            -23.3       6.44    -3.62  4.54e- 4\n10 HT           -741.     1108.      -0.669 5.05e- 1\n\n\nAccording to the fitting result, besides higher dose usage, higher Y is also associated with lower weight (\\(\\beta=-23.28\\), se=6.44). A weak association was found for age, sex, race, and height.\nNow I’m printing out the RMSE and R-squared from the two linear regression models.\n\n# Print RMSE and R-squared for both models\nresults1 &lt;- predict(model1, data_new) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(data_new) %&gt;%\n  metrics(truth=Y, estimate=.pred) %&gt;%\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 rmse    standard     666.   \n2 rsq     standard       0.516\n3 mae     standard     517.   \n\nresults2 &lt;- predict(model2, data_new) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(data_new) %&gt;%\n  metrics(truth=Y, estimate=.pred) %&gt;%\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 rmse    standard     590.   \n2 rsq     standard       0.620\n3 mae     standard     445.   \n\n\nAccording to the output, the RMSE for the first model is 666 and the R-squared is 0.52. For the second model, the RMSE is 590 and the R-squared is 0.62. In other words, putting in all predictors can better fit the data compared to only using DOSE, as the second model has a lower RMSE but a higher R-squared.\nI will fit the next logistic regression model using SEX as my response and DOSE as the predictor. The SEX variable has two levels 1 and 2, while 1 is the reference group.\n\n# Logistic regression: SEX ~ DOSE\nmodel3 &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\") %&gt;%\n  fit(SEX ~ DOSE, data_new)\n\n# Output the fitting result\ntidy(model3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic    p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  -1.59       0.347   -4.58   0.00000465\n2 DOSE37.5     -0.0202     0.849   -0.0238 0.981     \n3 DOSE50       -0.831      0.627   -1.33   0.185     \n\n\nAs shown, being SEX=1 is more likely to receive all three level of dose usage compared to SEX=2. The intercept denote the log odds of SEX=2 (vs SEX=1) when given DOSE=25. The coefficients -0.02 (se=0.85) and -0.83 (se=0.63) denote the change of log-odds when given DOSE=37.5 and DOSE=50, respectively. Next, I will fit the logistic regression with all predictors.\n\n# Logistic regression: SEX ~ all predictors\nmodel4 &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\") %&gt;%\n  fit(SEX ~ DOSE + AGE + RACE + WT + HT, data_new)\n\n# Output the fitting result\ntidy(model4)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  55.7      16.8      3.31    0.000937\n2 DOSE37.5     -3.11      1.84    -1.69    0.0916  \n3 DOSE50       -2.47      1.33    -1.86    0.0633  \n4 AGE           0.114     0.0696   1.64    0.101   \n5 RACE2        -2.40      1.39    -1.73    0.0843  \n6 RACE7         0.0168    3.56     0.00473 0.996   \n7 RACE88       -1.74      2.34    -0.743   0.457   \n8 WT           -0.0463    0.0716  -0.646   0.518   \n9 HT          -33.3      10.7     -3.10    0.00191 \n\n\nStill, dose usage is a significant predictor for SEX. When including all predictors, higher probability of being SEX=2 is also associated with lower HT (\\(\\beta=-33.26\\), se=10.72). Now I’m printing out the accuracy and ROC-AUC from the two logistic regression models.\n\n# Print RMSE and R-squared for both models\nresults3 &lt;- predict(model3, data_new, type=\"class\") %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(predict(model3, data_new, type=\"prob\")) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(data_new) %&gt;%\n  metrics(truth=SEX, estimate=.pred_class, .pred_1) %&gt;%\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.867\n2 kap         binary         0    \n3 mn_log_loss binary         0.384\n4 roc_auc     binary         0.592\n\nresults4 &lt;- predict(model4, data_new, type=\"class\") %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(predict(model4, data_new, type=\"prob\")) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(data_new) %&gt;%\n  metrics(truth=SEX, estimate=.pred_class, .pred_1) %&gt;%\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy    binary         0.95 \n2 kap         binary         0.772\n3 mn_log_loss binary         0.133\n4 roc_auc     binary         0.978\n\n\nAs shown, for the logistic regression model only using DOSE as the predictor, the classification accuracy is 0.87 and the ROC-AUC is 0.59. For the second logistic regression model using all predictors, the accuracy is 0.95 and the ROC-AUC is 0.98. By comparison, using all predictors has a better classification performance than using just DOSE. Though this research question does not make scientific science, but the assessment for the two models are straight forward for choosing the better one."
