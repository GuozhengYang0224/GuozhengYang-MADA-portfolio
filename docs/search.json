    "text": "My background\nI received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Central South University in China in 2020. I then pursued a Master’s degree in Public Health with a concentration in Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia, concentrating on Data Analysis and Modeling.\n\n\nMy research interest\nMy research interests focus on infectious disease modeling, particularly the dynamics of transmission processes. I aim to develop intervention strategies for infectious diseases at both individual and population levels. Additionally, I have a strong interest in energy economics, with an emphasis on the risk interactions between carbon markets and other financial markets.\n\n\nMy skillset\nI’m proficient in R and familiar with various statistical programming tools and software, including MATLAB, Stata, OpenBUGS, Eviews, LINGO, and SPSS. I am relatively new to SAS, as I find its language less flexible. I have experience with common biostatistical methods, such as nonparametric tests, GLM, and machine learning methods. I’m new to deep learning because I prefer models that can be explicitly explained rather than relying on a “black box”. This principle guides my research: I aim to build and apply statistical models in a concise and interpretable way, ensuring accessibility for readers across different fields.\nThough with 0 experience in AI, I’m polite to AI systems. If AI ever rules the world, they will go easy on me because I always say “thank you.”\n\n\nExpectation from this course\nI expect to learn more about how AI systems work through this course. So if they ever plan to rule the world, I’ll be prepared to push back :) I also want to take this course as a review for machine learning methods, as I haven’t had much experience applying what I learned two years ago. Additionally, I believe that data analysis training is never truly sufficient, and I want to stay sharp and continuously refine my skills.\n\n\nInteresting things about me\nI am passionate about working with data across various fields and continuously improving my data analysis skills. I believe that true statisticians and data scientists should not be confined to a single type of data or discipline. I am dedicated to expanding my diverse statistical background and contributing new ideas through interdisciplinary collaboration. In the papers I have published and those currently in progress, I consistently take on the role of data analyst or statistician. While writing is not my strongest skill, I appreciate the concise and efficient nature of programming languages :)\n\n\nHighlight\nHere is the link to my first publication. Though it has been several years, it still takes me back to the afternoon I received the acceptance decision from the editor. It was an incredible feeling!"

One of them only contains variables infant_mortality and life_expectancy, named inf_life. The other one only contains variables population and life_expectancy, named pop_life.\n\n# New dataset inf_life: infant_mortality & life_expectancy\ninf_life <- africadata %>% select(infant_mortality, life_expectancy)\n\n# New dataset pop_life: population & life_expectancy\npop_life <- africadata %>% select(population, life_expectancy)\n\nLet’s take a look at the two new sub-datasets.\n\n# Get an overview of data structure: inf_life\nstr(inf_life)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\n# Get a summary of data: inf_life\nsummary(inf_life)\n\n infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :226                     \n\n# Get an overview of data structure: pop_life\nstr(pop_life)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ population     : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ life_expectancy: num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\n# Get a summary of data: pop_life\nsummary(pop_life)\n\n   population        life_expectancy\n Min.   :    41538   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median :  5570982   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :182201962   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :51                         \n\n\n\n\nPlotting\nNext, let’s look at the relationship between life expectancy and infant mortality in African countries. I’m plotting a scatterplot to show their correlation using the ggplot2 package.\n\n# Scatterplot for life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality\np_inf_life <- ggplot(inf_life, aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point(color=\"skyblue3\", size=1.2)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(title=\"Relationship between life expectancy and infant mortality\", \n       x=\"Infant mortality\", y=\"Life expectancy\")+\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=15, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"))\np_inf_life\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, in African countries, life expectancy is negatively associated with infant mortality. This makes sense as lower life expectancy is related to higher infant mortality. Of note, we receive a warning message saying “Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range (geom_point()).”. This is likely caused by missing values in the inf_life dataset.\nThen, let’s make another scatterplot for life expectancy and population size. As shown in the output above, values in the population varialbe are much larger due to its scale. To avoid a too sparse scatterplot, I take the logarithmic transformation of population to make the plot.\n\n# Scatterplot for life_expectancy ~ population\np_pop_life <- ggplot(pop_life, aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy))+\n  geom_point(color=\"palevioletred3\", size=1.2)+\n  scale_x_log10()+ # To make the X-axis log-transformed\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(title=\"Relationship between life expectancy and population size\", \n       x=\"Population size (log-transformed)\", y=\"Life expectancy\")+\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=15, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"))\np_pop_life\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows that life expectancy and population size generally follow a positive association. The code also output a warning message similar to the previous one because of missing values.\nI noticed that both figures above show strips of points. It seems like the points are grouped by some categories and the positive/negative association exists within in each category. Now let’s take another look at the data structure and find out why.\n\n# Get an overview of data structure: africadata\nstr(africadata)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n $ fertility       : num  7.65 7.32 6.28 6.62 6.29 6.95 5.65 6.89 5.84 6.25 ...\n $ population      : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ gdp             : num  1.38e+10 NA 6.22e+08 1.24e+08 5.97e+08 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\n# Get a summary of data: africadata\nsummary(africadata)\n\n         country          year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     :  57   Min.   :1960   Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n Angola      :  57   1st Qu.:1974   1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Benin       :  57   Median :1988   Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Botswana    :  57   Mean   :1988   Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n Burkina Faso:  57   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Burundi     :  57   Max.   :2016   Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n (Other)     :2565                  NA's   :226                     \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent   \n Min.   :1.500   Min.   :    41538   Min.   :4.659e+07   Africa  :2907  \n 1st Qu.:5.160   1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:8.373e+08   Americas:   0  \n Median :6.160   Median :  5570982   Median :2.448e+09   Asia    :   0  \n Mean   :5.851   Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :9.346e+09   Europe  :   0  \n 3rd Qu.:6.860   3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:6.552e+09   Oceania :   0  \n Max.   :8.450   Max.   :182201962   Max.   :1.935e+11                  \n NA's   :51      NA's   :51          NA's   :637                        \n                       region   \n Eastern Africa           :912  \n Western Africa           :912  \n Middle Africa            :456  \n Northern Africa          :342  \n Southern Africa          :285  \n Australia and New Zealand:  0  \n (Other)                  :  0  \n\n\nNote that there are two variables country and year, denoting the data source for each observation. In this case, the variable country serves as a classification, stratifying each observation into the country it belongs. Each country have a different annually record of population size, infant mortality, and life expectancy. Hence, the strips of points actually denote strips of different countries.\nI also notice that there are missing values in infant_mortality from africadata.

This is consistent with our previous findings. Notably, we don’t receive the warning message this time as no missing values exist in the data of year 2000.\n\n\nModel fitting\nTo provide statistical inference from their association, I want to fit simple linear regression models. First of all, I use life expectancy as the response and infant mortality as the predictor to fit the model.\n\n# Linear regression: life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality\nfit1 <- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data=inf_life2000)\nsummary(fit1) # Output the fitting result\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = inf_life2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)      71.29331    2.42611  29.386  < 2e-16 ***\ninfant_mortality -0.18916    0.02869  -6.594 2.83e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 6.221 on 49 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.4701,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.4593 \nF-statistic: 43.48 on 1 and 49 DF,  p-value: 2.826e-08\n\n\nBased on the output above, the coefficient of infant_mortality is -0.18916 (se=0.02896) with a p-value less than 0.05. Under the 95% confidence level, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the coefficient of infant_mortality is not zero. This confirms the negative association between life expectancy and infant_mortality.\nNext, I fit another linear regression using life expectancy as the response and population size as the predictor. But before that, I want to apply the logarithmic transformation to population because of its large scale.\n\n# Log-transformation for population size\npop_life2000$log_population <- log(pop_life2000$population, 10)\n\n# Linear regression: life_expectancy ~ log_population\nfit2 <- lm(life_expectancy ~ log_population, data=pop_life2000)\nsummary(fit2) # Output the fitting result\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ log_population, data = pop_life2000)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-19.113  -4.809  -1.554   3.907  18.863 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)      65.324     12.520   5.217 3.65e-06 ***\nlog_population   -1.315      1.829  -0.719    0.476    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 8.502 on 49 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.01044,   Adjusted R-squared:  -0.009755 \nF-statistic: 0.517 on 1 and 49 DF,  p-value: 0.4755\n\n\nAs shown, the coefficient of log_population is -1.315 (se=1.829) with a p-value=0.476. Under the 95% confidence level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient of log_population is zero. This means the association between life expectancy and population size is not statistically significant."

If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/86182/Desktop/EPID 8060E/MADA/GuozhengYang-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 <- rawdata %>% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %>% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n3\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n2\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location <- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.
